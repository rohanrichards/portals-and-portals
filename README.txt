1)	Introduction
	------------

	A modern adaptation of the popular board game “Snakes and Ladders”, 
	Portals & Portals is set to shake up family time with hours of gameplay
	that will keep you on the edge! Snakes away - portals will make or 
	break your journey to the top as you attempt to traverse the gruelling 
	40 tile gameboard to win the ultimate prize and become the portal 
	master! Each portal is connected regenerating randomly at anytime and
	anywhere, warping players between connected tiles that will leave 
	players with the bitter taste of despair or an over-inflated sense 
	of achievement as victory nears. Face off against your friends in 
	multiplayer mode or take on the ruthless AI bot army - you will 
	surely not be able to put this game back in the box!

===========================================================================

2)	Running Instructions
	------------

	User must have Python 3.0 or above installed

	By default, text mode can be explicitly ran using:
	
		a) Run Command Prompt (cmd)
		b) Execute "Python [dir]\Portals.py"
	
	To launch the graphical user interface:
	
		a) Run Command Prompt (cmd)
		b) Execute "Python [dir]\Portals.py -g"
	
	Failing to append the -g command will cause the program to run in text
	mode.
